Covid-19 Detection From CT Scan Images Using Machine Learning &amp;&amp; Deep Learning (CNN)




The emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on economies and health around the world. The virus is easily spread in the community through contact, droplets when talking or sneezing. Therefore, detecting infected people and preventing the source of infection are very important in epidemic prevention. Currently, to detect patients infected with Covid-19, two common test methods are usually used: molecular test (Molecular Test) and antigen test (Antigen Test) that detect proteins on the surface of the virus. Covid-19. However, the application of these two measures also has limitations in terms of time and accuracy. To contribute to the fight against this pandemic, we proceed to build a model to detect Covid-19 through CT images of the patient's lungs with machine models and deep learning on the dataset [4]. Based on the following models: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest Classification (RFC) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The results obtained are quite good with the F1-Score measure of 0.98, 0.86, 0.95, 0.98 on the test dataset, respectively. After that, we conduct statistical results on the models to draw conclusions and choose the best effective learning model on the dataset [4] and give directions for future model development. .
